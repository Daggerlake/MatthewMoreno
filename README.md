# Notes

Received two deprecation warnings on running `npm install`.
* jade@1.11.0: Jade has been renamed to pug, please install the latest version of pug instead of jade
* transformers@2.1.0: Deprecated, use jstransformer

Apparently jQuery is now listed as a npm package, so I installed it using npm (`npm install jquery`) instead of downloading it manually and placing it in the `public/javascripts` folder of the applicaiton as suggested by the book.
